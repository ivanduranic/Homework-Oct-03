This Repository contains my first homework of the Boot Camp

Refactoring code project for Horiseon

Dear Horiseon Team,


Given the importance of the task you have entrusted me with,
I have undertaken the special measures to have this assignment
done in accordance with all the latest industry standards.


a) Divs in html have been renamed accordingly as header, section, article, asside and footer.

b) HTML elements follow a logical structure (added link to reset.css).

c) Alt attributes have been added to image elements.

d) Heading attributes fall in sequential order: h1, h2, h3 and h4.

e) Title element has been renamed accordingly.

f) Application links are made to function correctly by adding id attributes inside article's headings.

g) Application's CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure.

h) Application's HTML and CSS file are commented so you can easily track the refactoring I've made.
